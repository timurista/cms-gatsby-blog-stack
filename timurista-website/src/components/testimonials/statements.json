I especially appreciated that he was super knowledgeable about a multitude of technologies that were available and how they could help solve our problems and improve our products. He was also really good at suggesting new ideas and thinking about how we could get better with our process. I really got the impression he cared about his work, the team, and the success of the company and that is always a positive thing to have in an employee",

    "statement": "As a designer I think everyone should have a \"Tim\" on their team. He's a tactically gifted full stack engineer who is obsessed with making sure we're building the right things, the right way. It was a pleasure working with such a \"user-minded\" engineer, and Tim was nothing less than a champion of the gray area between design and development in an agile process that felt more like a symbiosis than a set of silos. All of our digital experiences from products to marketing benefitted from Tim's work and oversight, and no matter where he goes, they'll be lucky to have him.",
